<h1>No More Green Screen</h1>
<h3>Frick you, green screen. Now computer vision is my best friend.</h3>

<p>This is a project I'm making to help me make movies better. I like to make movies
	on TikTok and YouTube, and I do lots of fancy VFX to make them look cool (and mask
	my mediocre storytelling abilities). That VFX frequently involves dealing with green
screen. Green screen is a pain to use.</p>

<p>AI is cool, I'll just use that instead. At least I hope. I'm still very new to this.</p>
